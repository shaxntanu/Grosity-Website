# 🚚 Simplified Truck Loader - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### Problem:
- Truck was "teleporting" when exiting
- Complex slide animations causing position resets
- Jittery transitions

### Solution:
**Completely simplified the loader with clean fade animations**

## 🎯 New Simple Animation:

### Entry:
- Fades in smoothly (0.3s)
- Scales from 0.8 to 1.0
- No sliding, no teleporting

### Exit:
- Fades out smoothly (0.3s)
- Scales back to 0.8
- Clean and simple

## 💻 Simplified Code:

### Show Loader:
```javascript
showLoader();
```

### Hide Loader:
```javascript
hideLoader();
```

That's it! No complex timing, no hiding classes, just simple show/hide.

## 🎨 Features:

- ✅ No teleporting or jitter
- ✅ Smooth fade in/out
- ✅ Simple scale effect
- ✅ Clean transitions
- ✅ "Grosity" branding visible
- ✅ Animated truck with wheels
- ✅ Works perfectly every time

## 📝 Current Usage:

1. **Language switching** - Shows when changing language
2. **Form submission** - Shows during form processing
3. **Ready for API calls** - Use `showLoader()` / `hideLoader()`

## 🚀 Result:

The loader now has a professional, clean appearance with zero glitches. The truck stays centered and fades in/out beautifully without any position jumping or teleporting issues.
